# 100 Days of LeetCode

Welcome to my **100 Days of LeetCode** challenge repository! This project is dedicated to improving my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency by solving one LeetCode problem every day for 100 days.

## About the Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to consistently practice coding problems to prepare for technical interviews and strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms. Each day, I will solve at least one problem from LeetCode and document my progress here.


## Goals

1. Solve a variety of problems, including easy, medium, and hard levels.
2. Understand and implement different data structures and algorithms.
3. Improve coding efficiency and speed.
4. Document the learning process and solutions.
